# ndnSIM IFA simulation

This is an implementation of the Named Data Networking (NDN) interest flooding attack (IFA) and mitigation scenario described in the paper "A Gini Impurity-Based Interest Flooding Attack Defence Mechanism in NDN" by Zhi, Luo et al.

This code was based on the code at https://github.com/iyonr/ndn-ddos-ifa.

See build-instructions.txt for the steps I took to run the code on my machine (Ubuntu 18.04).
