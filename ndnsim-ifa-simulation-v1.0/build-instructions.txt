Follow the instructions on this page to download ns-3 and ndnSIM: https://github.com/iyonr/ndn-ddos-ifa

In order to compile using GCC v7.5.0, I needed to change the names of the functions "get_size", declared in ./src/ndnSIM/model/pit/custom-policies/serialized-size-policy.h, to get_sizexx

Then clone the scenario using these commands:

git clone git://github.com/iyonr/ndn-ddos-ifa.git ndn-ddos-ifa

cd ns-3
./waf configure -d optimized
./waf
sudo ./waf install

cd ndn-ddos-ifa

Compile using ./waf configure and ./waf.
There may be an error about boost libraries not being found in /lib64, which I solved with these commands:
cd /usr
sudo ln -s lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ lib64

You may also need:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
because otherwise it gives errors about .so files not being found.

Finally, the scenario can now be run from inside ndn-ddos-ifa.

Note: I also cannot seem to compile with ./waf configure --debug, because it just gives an error like "NS-3 or one of the required NS-3 modules not found" etc.

To fix this error, I probably need to add the locations of a lot of .pc files (in the ns3/build/src directory) to my PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable.
